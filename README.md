# Based on Community S3 E4 "Competitive Ecology", where Jeff asks Abed "the human computer" to determine partner pairings for the Greendale 7 plus Todd for their biology project. Abed did this by popularity ranking, but the most objective way to do this is to have each person rank who they'd like to work with - from most preferred to least. With this data and Pandas, matrices are constructed to:
# 1. Tabulate the preferred partners data
# 2. Assign a score based on each pairing
# 3. Create an upper matrix to sum each pairing
# Then, the 4 unique pairings with the highest sums are found, which determines the pairings.
